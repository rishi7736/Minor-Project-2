##**Overview**

This repository contains the implementation of a deep learning-based seizure detection model, designed to be integrated into wearable devices. By leveraging multimodal sensor data, our approach enhances seizure recognition accuracy, ultimately improving patient care and intervention strategies.


##**Dataset**

The dataset used in this project consists of sensor readings from wearable devices, capturing:
- Electrodermal Activity (EDA)
- Accelerometer (ACC)
- Heart Rate (HR)
- Blood Volume Pulse (BVP)
- EEG readings (if available)

To improve detection accuracy, we preprocess the dataset by removing unnecessary features and splitting it into training and validation sets.


##**Methodology**

**1. Data Preprocessing:** Removal of irrelevant columns, normalization, and train-validation splitting.

**2. Model Selection:** Implementation of multiple machine learning and deep learning models for comparison.

**3. Deep Learning Models:**
- Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN)
- Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
- Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
    
**4. Traditional Machine Learning Models:**
- XGBoost
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- Decision Tre*
- Random Forest
  
**5. Evaluation**: Models were evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

**6. Wearable Device Integration**: The final deep learning model is designed to be deployable on low-power wearable devices for real-time seizure detection.


##**Implementation**
Each model was trained using Python libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, and XGBoost. Hyperparameter tuning and optimization techniques such as early stopping and grid search were employed to enhance performance.


##**Results**

Each model's performance was measured using key metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
Graphs were plotted to visualize training loss, accuracy trends, and classification reports.


##**Potential Impact**

This project aims to revolutionize epilepsy management by enabling real-time seizure detection via wearable devices. Key benefits include:
- Timely Intervention: Reducing the risk of SUDEP by providing early alerts.
- Enhanced Caregiver Awareness: Empowering healthcare professionals with actionable insights.
- Improved Quality of Life: Offering a non-invasive, reliable solution for epilepsy monitoring.
